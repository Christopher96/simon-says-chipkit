Exception Handling
1. reg EPC, store current PC
2. reg Cause
3. jump to exception handler
4. push regs
5. handle exception
6. pop regs, EPC -> $k0, jr $k0

Static branch predictor
Predict at compile time

Dynamic branch predictor
Predict at run time
Operates in fetch state
Maintains branch target buffer


Temporal locality
You borrow the book you read often

Spatial locality
You borrow 10 books of the same shelf of closely related topics

Write policy
Write-through - Data is simultaneously written back to main memory while writing to cache
Write-back - Dirty bit is associated with each cache block


Cache           Virutal memory
Block           Page

MMU - Memory Management Unit
Translates virtual page numbers to physical page numbers

OS - Operating System
